# Data types are divided into two groups:

1. Primitive data types - includes byte, short, int, long, float, double, boolean and char
2. Non-primitive data types - such as String, Arrays and Classes 

# Primitive Data Types

A primitive data type specifies the size and type of variable values, and it has no additional methods.

There are eight primitive data types in Java:


| Data Type	| Size	 | Description                                                                      | 
|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| byte	    | 1 byte | Stores whole numbers from -128 to 127                                            | 
| short	    | 2 bytes| Stores whole numbers from -32,768 to 32,767                                      |
| int	    | 4 bytes| Stores whole numbers from -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647                        |
|long	    | 8 bytes| Stores whole numbers from -9,223,372,036,854,775,808 to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807|
|float	    | 4 bytes| Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 6 to 7 decimal digits          |
|double	    | 8 bytes| Stores fractional numbers. Sufficient for storing 15 decimal digits              |
|boolean	| 1 bit	 | Stores true or false values                                                      |
|char	    | 2 bytes| Stores a single character/letter or ASCII values                                 |

# Non-Primitive Data Types

Non-primitive data types are called reference types because they refer to objects.

The main difference between primitive and non-primitive data types are:

* Primitive types are predefined (already defined) in Java. Non-primitive types are created by the programmer and is not defined by Java (except for String).
* Non-primitive types can be used to call methods to perform certain operations, while primitive types cannot.
* A primitive type has always a value, while non-primitive types can be null.
* A primitive type starts with a lowercase letter, while non-primitive types starts with an uppercase letter.
* The size of a primitive type depends on the data type, while non-primitive types have all the same size.
* Examples of non-primitive types are Strings, Arrays, Classes, Interface, etc. You will learn more about these in a later chapter.
