  - Determine the radius in cm of the different sized disks.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Measure the disk’s diameter using a ruler and apply the 2-5-8 rule for the last uncertain digit.

2.  Divide the measured length by 2.

<!-- end list -->

  - Determine the mass, in g, of the different sized disks.

<!-- end list -->

1.  Measure the mass of each disk using a scale.

<!-- end list -->

  - Determine the height (thickness) in cm of the disk material. (\*Density<sub>Aluminum</sub>= 2.70 g/cm)

<!-- end list -->

1.  Use the density equation to find the height. Height = (density \*Area of the disk) / mass

2.  Do this for all the disks

Pre-experiment question:

1.  What is the precision of the meterstick used? Explain how you know using the data you found.

The precision of the meterstick used is to the 100th of a cm. I know this because I measured exactly to the last millimeter (10th’s place) and then used the 2-5-8 rule for the last uncertain digit (100th’s place)

Graph \#1- Radius vs Mass

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-25-AP-Physics---Measurement-and-Graphical-analysis/media/image1.jpg)

Non-linear or quadratic graph showing the relationship between mass(g) of disks (y axis) and radius(cm) of disks (x axis), assuming uniform thickness.

Equation:y= 0.012463x^2 + 0.053317-0.099991

Graph \#2- Linearized Graph (Radius)^2 vs Mass

![]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/img/2022-08-25-AP-Physics---Measurement-and-Graphical-analysis/media/image2.jpg)

This is a linearized graph with radius squared(cm^2)(x-axis) and mass(g)(y-axis).

How did we linearize our graph? From the original table , we squared the radius and kept the mass same because we found that the original graph of non-linearized data looked very similar to a parabola and so figured out that, if we square the radius, the graph becomes linearized.

Best fit line equation: y=0.010141+0.018138x
