    "> A brief overview of Bash, on your way to becoming a Linux expert.  When a computer boots up, a kernel (MacOS, Windows, Linux) is started.  This kernel provides a shell that allows user to interact with a most basic set of commands.  Typically, the casual user will not interact with the shell as a Desktop User Interface is started by the computer boot up process.  To activate the shell directly, users will run a \"terminal\" through the Desktop, VS Code or activate \"console\" while on a cloud computer like AWS.\n",
